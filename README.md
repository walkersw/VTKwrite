# VTKwrite

Python package to write VTK files in XML format

- This class can write a static unstructured grid, with time-dependent data, all in the same .vtu file!

- This package was forked from another package "PyEVTK" by Paulo A. Herrera.

https://github.com/paulo-herrera/PyEVTK

- Installation is done in the standard way:  ```python setup.py install```

- You need Python 3.6 or better.

## Usage

After installing, go to the ./examples/ sub-directory and do this:
```
python runall.py run
```
to run the examples; you can also do
```
python runall.py clean
```
to delete the output.

The individual Python files should give you enough information to use this package.
